# Progressive AI Academy: Action Plan

**Date**: 2025-04-26

## 1. Overview
Progressive AI Academy is a next-generation learning platform that leverages AI to deliver adaptive, personalized education from elementary through graduate levels. The platform uses modern web technologies and Cloudflare's edge infrastructure for a scalable, fast, and secure experience.

## 2. Architecture & Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Vite + React + shadcn/ui (Tailwind CSS), built to `dist/`
- **Backend/API**: Hono server running on Cloudflare Workers (TypeScript)
- **AI SDK**: Anthropic Claude (JavaScript/TypeScript SDK)
- **Database**: Cloudflare D1 (SQL), KV (caching/session)
- **Hosting/Infra**: Cloudflare Workers (serving API and static assets from `dist/`), Wrangler for CI/CD
- **Auth**: Clerk.js with GitHub provider

## 3. Cloudflare Usage
- **Static Assets**: Built frontend (`dist/`) is served directly by the Hono Worker using Cloudflare's edge network for low-latency global access.
- **API**: All backend endpoints (lesson data, user progress, chat, etc.) are handled by Hono routes on the Worker.
- **Data**: Cloudflare D1 is used for structured data (users, lessons, progress), and KV for fast key-value caching and session storage.
- **AI**: Anthropic Claude SDK is called from the Worker for adaptive recommendations and tutoring.
- **CI/CD**: Wrangler scripts automate build, local dev, and deployment to Cloudflare.
